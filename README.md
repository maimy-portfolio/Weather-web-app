# 🌤️ Weather Web App

This weather-checking app was built by following a beginner-friendly tutorial from [GreatStack](https://youtu.be/MIYQR-Ybrn4?si=MPIiYfFZ_qiUsGmr). 
It was one of the first projects that helped me understand how to fetch data from an external API and dynamically update the UI using JavaScript.
